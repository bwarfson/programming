The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

Basically, the ISP states that we should reduce code objects down to the smallest required implementation thus creating interfaces with only required declarations. As a result, an interface that has a lot of different declarations should be split up into smaller interfaces.
